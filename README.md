Instructions:
For Mac/Linux machine
1) Navigate to the project folder
2) Enter command "mix run proj1.exs <arg1> <arg2>"

Input format:
n is arg1
k is arg2

Output format:
First number of sequence for all perfect squares are printed in no definite order as it runs in multiple cores


------------------------------------------------
No.of Machines:
1



-------------------------------------------------

Size of the work Unit: (n/number of cores) - Size of the work unit depends on the given n value and number of cores. For n<14 number of cores is chosen to be 2 for ideal performance and 15 is chosen for n>14 and based on that work unit size varies.

For example - for n = 60, number of cores = 15 => size of work unit = 4

The result of running your program for - mix run proj1.exs 1000000 4 : 

Nothing is displayed


The running time for the above: 

real	0m2.809s

sys	  0m0.181s

The Largest problem we managed to solve: 
Efficiency is achieved by selecting ideal number of cores.
Largest n value - 10000000 k - 2
